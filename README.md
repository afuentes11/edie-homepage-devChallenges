The project consists of creating a responsive landing page for a fictitious software development company, EDIE. [The original design](https://www.figma.com/file/ahnGupP4JjTdVJDTRfMRF2?chrome=DOCUMENTATION&embed_host=astra&kind=&node-id=0%3A1&viewer=1) was provided by Devchallenges in the challenge.

The page can be viewed at the following [link](https://afuentes11.github.io/edie-homepage-devChallenges/). If you liked the project, give me a star ‚≠ê.

At the beginning of the project I set out to learn a new technology to better organize CSS code, and what better tool than SASS, a CSS code preprocessor that basically gives you superpowers, it allows you to use functions, conditionals, iterators to structure CSS code. Learning to use this technology is necessary to be able to develop better and better interfaces with cleaner and more readable code.

On the other hand, I kept learning about JQUERY and in turn strengthening my programming logic.
