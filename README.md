The project consists of the creation of a responsive checkout page for an online shop. [The original design](https://www.figma.com/file/4B0x88GhiZvgVlcQPSQ73D?chrome=DOCUMENTATION&embed_host=astra&kind=&node-id=0%3A1&viewer=1) was provided by Devchallenges in the challenge.

The page can be viewed at the following [link](https://afuentes11.github.io/checkout-page-devChallenge/). If you liked the project, give me a star ‚≠ê.

The development of the website was a challenge, despite being a simple form, due to the multiple functionalities it required, such as the implementation of modals, form validation and allowing to be able to vary the quantity of each product.
For the functionality I used JQUERY, in order to get to know the library and be able to extend my development stack.
